### Zegel 2024-2: Python Programming Final Task 🐍💻
## Project Description 📚
This repository contains materials, scripts, and documentation developed for the Python Programming course during the 2024-2 term at Zegel IPAE. It focuses on practical learning and the final evaluation of the course, providing a solid foundation in Python programming through examples, exercises, and a final project.

## Repository Content 📁
# 1. Course Exercises 📝
Scripts covering fundamental concepts:
Variables, data types, and basic operations.
Control structures (conditionals, loops).
Functions and code modularity.
Error and exception handling.
Working with lists, dictionaries, and sets.
# 2. Intermediate Exercises 🚀
Advanced practices like:
File handling (reading/writing).
Using standard libraries such as os, datetime, math, etc.
Introduction to external libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
## 3. Final Project 🏆
Development of a final task integrating all learned concepts.
# Example projects:
A basic CRUD system for data management.
Data analysis and interactive graph generation.
Automation of repetitive tasks using custom scripts.
## 4. Documentation 📖
Explanatory files about:
How to run the project.
Troubleshooting.
Environment setup and dependencies.
